# Navigation Management System Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive Navigation Management system similar to Shopify's navigation interface. The system will allow administrators to create, manage, and organize website navigation menus with drag-and-drop functionality, nested menu items, and multiple menu locations.

## Requirements

3. WHEN an admin selects a menu location THEN the system SHALL show available locations (Header Primary, Header Secondary, Footer Primary, Footer Secondary, Sidebar)
4. WHEN an admin saves a new menu THEN the system SHALL create the menu and redirect to the menu editor
5. WHEN an admin deletes a menu THEN the system SHALL remove the menu and all its associated navigation items
6. WHEN an admin views a menu THEN the system SHALL display the menu's current structure and items

### Requirement 2: Navigation Item Management

7. WHEN an admin adds an icon to a navigation item THEN the system SHALL allow selection from available icons

### Requirement 3: Drag and Drop Functionality

5. WHEN drag and drop operations occur THEN the system SHALL automatically update the order values for affected items
6. WHEN an admin performs drag and drop THEN the system SHALL provide undo functionality for the last operation

### Requirement 4: Nested Menu Structure

6. WHEN the system processes nested items THEN it SHALL support unlimited nesting levels

### Requirement 5: Menu Preview and Testing

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to preview how my navigation will look on the website, so that I can verify the structure and styling before publishing.

#### Acceptance Criteria
