## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Responsive Preview
```tsx
<ResponsivePreviewController
    heroProps={heroProps}
    previewComponent={HeroCenteredPreview}
    onChange={handlePropsChange}
    showControls={true}
    enableRealTimeUpdates={true}
/>
```

### Advanced Preview with All Features
```tsx
<AdvancedPreview
    props={heroProps}
    previewComponent={HeroCenteredPreview}
    onChange={handlePropsChange}
    onInteraction={handleInteraction}
    initialConfig={{
        mode: 'desktop',
        context: 'interactive',
        showGrid: true,
        showRulers: true,
        enableInteractions: true
    }}
/>
```

### Real-time Preview Hook
```tsx
const {
    currentProps,
    updatePreview,
    performanceMetrics,
    isUpdating
} = useRealTimePreview(initialProps, {
    enabled: true,
    debounceMs: 300,
    enablePerformanceMonitoring: true
});
```
